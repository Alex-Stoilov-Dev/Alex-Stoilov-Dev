# 👋 Hey, I’m Alexander Stoilov

I’m a passionate backend-focused developer with a strong foundation in technical support, server management, and computer systems.

## 🎓 My Education

- Currently entering my **second year** of my **bachelor's degree** in **Computer Systems and Technology**  
- Graduated from a **vocational school of home appliances** with a focus in **Computer Technology and Engineering**

## 🛠️ My Background

For almost a year, I’ve worked in technical support, where I:

- Helped clients with **Mail**, **DNS**, **SSH**, **FTP** support  
- Registered and managed **domain names**  
- Installed **SSL certificates** and resolved SSL-related issues  
- Worked with **databases**: created backups, imported databases via terminal, resolved issues (like repairing corrupt **WordPress** tables), and automated regular optimizations using **bash scripts** and **cron jobs**  
- Troubleshot and resolved **WordPress** website problems  
- Reviewed **server logs** and monitored **resource usage** using internal tools

This hands-on server work naturally steered me toward **backend development**, where I’m most at home.

## 💻 What I Code

- **C / C++** – My strongest languages  
- **Java** – Built **REST APIs** and created **game mods**  
- **SQL / Databases** – Comfortable with **backups**, **imports**, **optimizations**, and **troubleshooting**  
- **Bash scripting** – Automated tasks and database maintenance  
- **Godot (GDScript)** – Working on a small game project  
- **C + SDL2** – Built a basic game project

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

- Expanding my backend skills and building scalable apps  
- Learning more about system design and high-performance applications  
- Tinkering with game dev projects in my free time
