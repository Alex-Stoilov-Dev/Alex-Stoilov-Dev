# 👋 Hey, I’m Alexander Stoilov

I’m a passionate backend-focused developer with a strong foundation in technical support and server management.

## 🛠️ My Background  
For almost a year, I’ve worked in technical support, where I:

- Helped clients with **Mail**, **DNS**, **SSH**, **FTP** support  
- Registered and managed **domain names**  
- Troubleshot and resolved **WordPress** website issues  
- Reviewed **server logs** and monitored **resource usage** using in-house infrastructure built by my company, and helped resolve cases where malicious activity was detected on user websites.

This hands-on server work naturally steered me toward **backend development**, where I’m most at home.

## 💻 What I Code

- **C / C++** – My strongest languages  
- **Java** – Built **REST APIs** and created **game mods**  
- **Godot (GDScript)** – Working on a small game project  
- **C + SDL2** – Built a basic game project

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

- Expanding my backend skills and building scalable apps  
- Learning more about system design and high-performance applications  
- Tinkering with game dev projects in my free time
